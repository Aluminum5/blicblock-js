Blicblock is a game your Sims in The Sims 4 can play on the computer. I thought
it would be fun to recreate the game. Our Sims shouldn't have all the fun!

## Notes about Blicblock:

- Looks like Tetris meets Bejeweled: colored blocks fall down. Combine them into Tetrominos and the Tetromino disappears.
- Disappearing Tetrominos cause blocks on top of them to fall, which can cause cascades of disappearing blocks.
- If screen fills up and no more blocks can fall, game over.
- Colors: magenta, yellow, green, blue
- Five blocks across, seven tall
