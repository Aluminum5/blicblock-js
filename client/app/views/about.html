      <h2>About BlicblockJS</h2>
      <p>
        Blicblock is a game your Sims can play in The Sims 4. After seeing my
        Sims play it enough on their computers, I realized it looked like a
        fully developed game idea, and not just bits of color flashing around
        on their screens.
      </p>
      <h3>Who made BlicblockJS?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm <a href="http://www.sarah-vessels.com/">Sarah Vessels</a>, a
        programmer in Lexington, Kentucky. I love The Sims series and
        programming, so I combined the two and made BlicblockJS!
      </p>
      <h3>Can I see the source code?</h3>
